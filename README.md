# Jira Login
Used to store credentials for later use by other Jira Actions

> ##### Only supports Jira Cloud. Does not support Jira Server (hosted)

This is required by other actions like:
- [`Transition`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-transition) - Transition a Jira issue
- [`Comment`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-comment) - Add a comment to a Jira issue
- [`Create`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-create) - Create a new Jira issue
- [`Find issue key`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-find) - Search for an issue key in commit message, branch name, etc. This issue key is then saved and used by the next actions in the same workflow
- [`TODO`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-todo) - Create a Jira issue for each TODO comment in committed code
- [`CLI`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-cli) - Wrapped [go-jira](https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/go-jira) CLI for common Jira actions

## Usage

```yaml
on: push

name: Jira Example

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Jira Example
